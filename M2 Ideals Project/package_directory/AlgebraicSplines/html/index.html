      <h1>AlgebraicSplines -- a package for working with splines on simplicial complexes, polytopal complexes, and graphs</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div>
          <p>This package provides methods for computations with piecewise polynomial functions (splines) over polytopal complexes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Let $\Delta$ be a partition (simplicial,polytopal,cellular,rectilinear, etc.) of a space $\RR^n$. The spline module $S^{r}(\Delta)$ is the module of all functions $f$ continuously differentiable to order $r$ such that $f$ is a polynomial when restricted to each facet $\sigma\in\Delta$. The vector space $S^r_d(\Delta)$ consists of splines whose polynomial restrictions have degree at most $d$. Its dimension is of particular interest in approximation theory (see [10]).</p>
          <p>The foundations of the algebraic approach to splines (as it applies to numerical analysis) was developed by Billera and Rose in [1],[2],[3]. In particular, it is shown in [3] that dim$S^r_d(\Delta)=$dim$S^r(c\Delta)_d$, where $S^r(c\Delta)_d$ is the vector space of splines of degree exactly $d$ on the cone $c\Delta$ over $\Delta$.  So the statistic dim$S^r_d(\Delta)$ is the Hilbert function of $S^r(c\Delta)$.  The functions <a title="compute matrix whose kernel is the module of $C^r$ splines on $\\Delta$" href="_spline__Matrix.html">splineMatrix</a> and <a title="compute the module of all splines on partition of a space" href="_spline__Module.html">splineModule</a> construct the matrix from [3] whose kernel is $S^r(\Delta)$, and the module $S^r(\Delta)$, respectively.  The functions <a title="a table with the dimensions of the graded pieces of a graded module" href="_spline__Dimension__Table.html">splineDimensionTable</a> and <a title="a table to compare the values of the hilbertFunction and hilbertPolynomial of a graded module" href="_hilbert__Comparison__Table.html">hilbertComparisonTable</a> display the statistic dim$S^r_d(\Delta)$ and compare it to the long term dimension formula, respectively.</p>
          <p>In [1], Billera uses a homological approach to solve a conjecture of Strang on the dimension of the space $S^1_d(\Delta)$.  The chain complex which he defines in [1] was later modified by Schenck and Stillman in [10]; we will call this the Billera-Schenck-Stillman chain complex.  It has appeared in many papers due to its use in finding dim$S^r_d(\Delta)$; perhaps most notable is [11].  In [10] the chain complex is also used to compute dimension formulas in the polytopal setting.  The Billera-Schenck-Stillman complex is implemented by the method <a title="creates the Billera-Schenck-Stillman chain complex" href="_spline__Complex.html">splineComplex</a>.  The Billera-Schenck-Stillman chain complex is a quotient of the cellular chain complex of $\Delta$ (relative to the boundary of $\Delta$); the latter is computed by <a title="create the cellular chain complex whose homologies are the singular homologies of the complex $\\Delta$ relative to its boundary" href="_cellular__Complex.html">cellularComplex</a>.  The kernel of this surjection is given by <a title="creates the Billera-Schenck-Stillman chain complex of ideals" href="_ideals__Complex.html">idealsComplex</a>.</p>
          <p>The functions mentioned thus far are concerned only with the structure of $S^r(\Delta)$ as a module over the polynomial ring.  The method <a title="given a sub-module of a free module (viewed as a ring with direct sum structure) which is also a sub-ring, creates a ring map whose image is the module with its ring structure" href="_ring__Structure.html">ringStructure</a> constructs $S^r(\Delta)$ as a quotient of a polynomial ring, thus recovering its ring structure.  In [2], Billera shows that there is a natural isomorphism between the affine Stanley-Reisner ring $K_a[\Delta]$ (see explanation in documentation for <a title="given a sub-module of a free module (viewed as a ring with direct sum structure) which is also a sub-ring, creates a ring map whose image is the module with its ring structure" href="_ring__Structure.html">ringStructure</a>) of a simplicial complex and the ring $S^0(\Delta)$ of continuous piecewise polynomials on $\Delta$. The isomorphism identifies the variable corresponding to a vertex with the Courant function for that vertex. The method <a title="returns the Courant functions of a simplicial complex" href="_courant__Functions.html">courantFunctions</a> computes these functions, and the method <a title="Creates a ring map whose image is the ring of piecewise continuous polynomials on $\\Delta$.  If $\\Delta$ is simplicial, the Stanley Reisner ring of $\\Delta$ is returned." href="_stanley__Reisner.html">stanleyReisner</a> constructs the isomorphism identified in [2].  Moreover, the rings $S^r(\Delta)$ live inside $S^0(\Delta)$ - this is of particular interest when $\Delta$ is simplicial due to Billera's result.  The method <a title="creates a ring map whose image is the sub-ring of $C^0(\\Delta)$ generated by $C^r(\\Delta)$.  If $\\Delta$ is simplicial, $C^0(\\Delta)$ is the Stanley Reisner ring of $\\Delta$." href="_stanley__Reisner__Presentation.html">stanleyReisnerPresentation</a> constructs $S^r(\Delta)$ as a quotient of a ring map from a polynomial ring into $S^0(\Delta)$; in particular the generators of $S^r(\Delta)$ are presented in terms of generators of $S^0(\Delta)$.  If $\Delta$ is simplicial these are selected to be the Courant functions.</p>
          <p>In topology, splines arise as equivariant cohomology of spaces with a torus action via GKM theory - see [14] for a survey of how this relates to splines in numerical analysis; and [6] for the precise relationship between continuous splines and the equivariant Chow cohomology of toric varieties.  From this perspective, the notion of generalized splines on graphs was introduced in [5].  The method <a title="the module of generalized splines associated to a simple graph with an edge labelling" href="_generalized__Splines.html">generalizedSplines</a> computes splines in this more flexible setting.  The relationship to splines in numerical analysis is via the dual graph described by Rose in [7],[8].</p>
          <p>Additionally, there are connections between splines and the module of multi-derivations of a hyperplane arrangement.  A basic structural connection was noticed in [3].  For the braid arrangement and its sub-arrangements, the module of derivations is isomorphic to a ring of splines in a natural way (see [11] and [4]).</p>
          <p>Methods in this package borrow from code written by Hal Schenck.</p>
