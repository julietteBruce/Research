      <div>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div>
          <p>This package contains the types of graphs that are used in algebraic statistics: <a title="a graph with bidirected edges and no multiple edges" href="___Bigraph.html">Bigraph</a> and  <a title="a graph that has undirected, directed and bidirected edges" href="___Mixed__Graph.html">MixedGraph</a>.</p>
          <p>A bigraph is graph with bidirected edges and no multiple edges. A mixed graph is a graph with undirected, directed and bidirected edges.</p>
          <p>This is an example of a bigraph on 4 vertices. It is created using the method <a title="create a bigraph" href="_bigraph.html">bigraph</a>.</p>
          <p></p>

        <div>
          <p>Next is an example of a mixed graph on 4 vertices with undirected, directed and bidirected edges. It is created using the method <a title="create a mixed graph from a combination of undirected graph, digraph and bigraph" href="_mixed__Graph.html">mixedGraph</a>.</p>
          <p></p>

          <p>One can extract key information about mixed graphs using: <a title="extract the undirected graph component of a mixed graph" href="_undirected__Graph.html">undirectedGraph(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="extract the bigraph component of a mixed graph" href="_bigraph_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">bigraph(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="extract the digraph component of a mixed graph" href="_digraph_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">digraph(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="create a union of all vertices of a mixed graph" href="_vertices_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">vertices(MixedGraph)</a>,</p>
          <p>or convert a mixed graph into a more convenient form using: <a title="convert a mixed graph into a new mixed graph where each component subgraph has the same set of vertices" href="_collate__Vertices.html">collateVertices(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="relabel the vertices of a mixed graph according to their indices, indexed from 0" href="_index__Label__Graph_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">indexLabelGraph(MixedGraph)</a>.</p>
          <p>There are several methods that allow to check the properties of mixed graphs: <a title="check whether a mixed graph contains a directed cycle" href="_is__Cyclic_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">isCyclic(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="check whether a graph contains a loop" href="_is__Loopless.html">isLoopless(MixedGraph)</a>, <a title="check whether a mixed graph is simple" href="_is__Simple_lp__Mixed__Graph_rp.html">isSimple(MixedGraph)</a>.</p>
          <p>One can also study the properties of vertices using: <a title="return the children of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_children_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">children(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the parents of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_parents_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">parents(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the descendants of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_descendants_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">descendants(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the nondescendents of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_nondescendants_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">nondescendants(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the forefathers of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_forefathers_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">forefathers(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the neighbors of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_neighbors_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">neighbors(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>, <a title="return the neighbors of a vertex of a mixed graph" href="_nonneighbors_lp__Mixed__Graph_cm__Thing_rp.html">nonneighbors(MixedGraph,Thing)</a>.</p>
          <p>This package allows to construct loopless mixed graphs (LMG) as introduced in Kayvan Sadeghi and Steffen Lauritzen, <em>Markov properties for mixed graphs</em>, Bernoulli 20.2 (2014): 676-696 and to check whether a mixedGraph is an LMG using <a title="partition the vertices of a loopless mixed graph into adjacent to undirected edges and adjacent to bidirected edges" href="_partition__L__M__G.html">partitionLMG</a>.</p>
