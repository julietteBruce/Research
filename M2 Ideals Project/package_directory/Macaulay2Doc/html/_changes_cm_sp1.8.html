        <ul>
          <li>
new packages:            <ul>
              <li>
<a title="binomial edge ideals" href="../../BinomialEdgeIdeals/html/index.html">BinomialEdgeIdeals</a>, a package by Tobias Windisch for computations with binomial edge ideals, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="Computation of parts of the Tate resolution on products" href="../../TateOnProducts/html/index.html">TateOnProducts</a>, a package by Daniel Erman, David Eisenbud, and Frank-Olaf Schreyer for Tate resolutions on products of projective spaces, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="for computations with lattice polytopes" href="../../LatticePolytopes/html/index.html">LatticePolytopes</a>, a package by Anders Lundman and Gustav Sædén Ståhl for computations with lattice polytopes, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="Computing Fitting ideals and Quot schemes of points" href="../../FiniteFittingIdeals/html/index.html">FiniteFittingIdeals</a>, a package by Gustav Sædén Ståhl for computing Fitting ideals of finite modules, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="&quot;Higher CI operators on a resolution over a complete intersection&quot;" href="../../HigherCIOperators/html/index.html">HigherCIOperators</a>, a package by David Eisenbud for computing higher complete intersection operators, has been added. It implements some work of Burke, Eisenbud and Schreyer on a structure that exists on resolutions over a complete intersection. This structure allows one to <em>lift</em> a resolution over a complete intersection to a resolution over the ambient ring -— a construction dual, in a sense, to the well known Eisenbud-Shamash construction, which is also implemented.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="Common types for Lie groups and Lie algebras" href="../../LieTypes/html/index.html">LieTypes</a>, a package by Dave Swinarski for defining types used by the package <a title="for vector bundles of conformal blocks on the moduli space of curves" href="../../ConformalBlocks/html/index.html">ConformalBlocks</a>, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="for vector bundles of conformal blocks on the moduli space of curves" href="../../ConformalBlocks/html/index.html">ConformalBlocks</a>, a package by Dave Swinarski for computing ranks and first Chern classes of conformal block bundles on the moduli space of n-pointed curves of genus 0, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="calculations for divisors and curves on the moduli space of stable n-pointed genus zero curves" href="../../M0nbar/html/index.html">M0nbar</a>, a package by Han-Bom Moon and David Swinarski for calculations for divisors and F-curves on the moduli space of stable n-pointed genus zero curves, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="Describe a graded module over k[x,y] without 0-dimensional torsion" href="../../AnalyzeSheafOnP1/html/index.html">AnalyzeSheafOnP1</a>, a package by David Eisenbud for decomposing a coherent sheaf on the projective line into a direct sum of line bundles and cyclic skyscraper sheaves, has been added.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
improved packages:            <ul>
              <li>
The package <a title="a package for binomial ideals" href="../../Binomials/html/index.html">Binomials</a> has been upgraded from version 1.0 to 1.2.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="Betti diagram routines" href="../../BoijSoederberg/html/index.html">BoijSoederberg</a> has been upgraded from version 1.2 to 1.5.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="More ChainComplex Functionality." href="../../ChainComplexExtras/html/index.html">ChainComplexExtras</a> has been upgraded from version 0.5 to version 1.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="multiplier ideals" href="../../MultiplierIdeals/html/index.html">MultiplierIdeals</a> has been upgraded from version 1.0 to version 1.1.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="&quot;Resolution over a Complete Intersection&quot;" href="../../CompleteIntersectionResolutions/html/index.html">CompleteIntersectionResolutions</a> has been upgraded from version 0.8 to version 0.9. It implements a number of old and new ideas about minimal resolutions over a complete intersection developed by Eisenbud-Peeva, Avramov-Jorgensen, Eisenbud-Peeva-Schreyer, and Burke-Eisenbud-Schreyer. Let <tt>S = k[x_1..x_n]</tt> be a polynomial ring, ff a codimension c regular sequence of homogeneous forms of the same degree, and <tt>R = S/(ff)</tt>. It contains:                <ul>
                  <li>
routines to compute the structure of <em>higher matrix factorization</em> on a <em>high</em> R-syzygy M — one for which the modules <tt>Ext_R^even(M,k)</tt> and <tt>Ext_R^odd(M,k)</tt> have negative regularity over the ring of CI operators. There are also routines to extract various information from the higher matrix factorization.                  </li>
                  <li>
routines that implement the reconstruction algorithm of Avramov and Jorgensen that constructs modules M having (certain kinds of) specified Ext-modules.                  </li>
                  <li>
routines to test of a conjecture of Eisenbud about the vanishing of certain local cohomology of Ext-modules, implementing the map from a module to its saturation.                  </li>
                  <li>
routines to compute the higher homotopies for ff on an S-free resolution of an S-module M annihilated by ff, and understanding the structure of module over an exterior algebra, determined by the ff-homotopies on a resolution of M, on Tor^S(M,N) and Ext_S(M,N), when M and N are S-modules annihilated by ff. These routines led to conjectures that were later proven, and will appear in a work-in-progress of Eisenbud, Peeva and Schreyer.                  </li>
                  <li>
routines to compute Hom in the stable category of Cohen-Macaulay R-modules, and test for stable triviality. This is used in understanding possible obstructions to commutativity of CI-operators.                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The function <a title="list the pairs in a hash table, dictionary, or basic list" href="_pairs.html">pairs</a> will now accept (basic) list (or sequence) <tt>x</tt> and return the list of pairs <tt>(i,x#i)</tt>, thanks to Zach Teitler.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="compute a minimal presentation" href="_minimal__Presentation.html">minimalPresentation</a> has been modified so that it applies its degree-preserving method also for homogeneous modules over affine algebras over affine algebras.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="apply a function to each key in a hash table" href="_apply__Keys.html">applyKeys</a> will now accept an additional function to be called when collisions occur between new keys, for combining the corresponding values, thanks to Paul Zinn-Justin.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="partition a set or list by values of a function" href="_partition.html">partition</a> now takes a third argument: a list of additional values in the range of the function, allowing members of the resulting partition to be empty.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="load a package" href="_load__Package.html">loadPackage</a> can now be used to reload a package by giving the package itself as the argument.  This is easier than setting the <a title="load a package" href="_load__Package.html">loadPackage(...,Reload=>...)</a> option.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="an adjoint map" href="_adjoint_lp__Matrix_cm__Module_cm__Module_rp.html">adjoint</a> has been improved to work not just for free modules, and the function <tt>adjoint1</tt> has been replaced by <a title="an adjoint map" href="_adjoint_sq_lp__Matrix_cm__Module_cm__Module_rp.html">adjoint'</a>.  This pair of function now implements both direction in the adjointness between Hom and tensor product.              </li>
              <li>
The new function <a title="get the element of Hom from a homomorphism" href="_homomorphism_sq.html">homomorphism'</a> complements <a title="get the homomorphism from element of Hom" href="_homomorphism.html">homomorphism</a>.  From a map between modules it produces the element of Hom.              </li>
              <li>
The new function <a title="composition as a pairing on Hom-modules" href="_compose_lp__Module_cm__Module_cm__Module_rp.html">compose</a> expresses composition of maps between modules as a bilinear map between Hom-modules.              </li>
              <li>
Bracket powers of ideals (<a title="bracket power of an ideal" href="___Ideal_sp^_sp__Array.html">Ideal ^ Array</a>) have been added, thanks to Frank Moore.              </li>
              <li>
Several bugs related to computing Groebner bases in polynomial rings over ZZ have been fixed.  <tt>trim I</tt> in this case now returns an ideal or module with a Groebner basis as generating set, as a minimal generating set isn't well-defined.  In a future release, we hope to provide a function to determine a smaller set of generators.  <tt>mingens I</tt> also returns the Groebner basis matrix.  In a future release this function might be changed to give an error in cases where there is not a well-defined notion of minimal generators.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality changed:            <ul>
              <li>
The function <a title="export symbols from a package" href="_export.html">export</a> now accepts strings and options only, not symbols.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
