      <h1>binary methods</h1>
      <div>
The method for computing a sum <tt>x+y</tt> depends on the types of <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>. For example, the method for adding an integer <tt>x</tt> and a polynomial <tt>y</tt> differs from the method for adding two integers modulo 111.  Because both the type of <tt>x</tt> and the type of <tt>y</tt> must enter into the selection of the method, we refer to these methods as binary methods.  Each binary method is a function of two variables, and is stored either in the class of <tt>x</tt> or in the class of <tt>y</tt>.        <p/>
Let's assume that <tt>X</tt> is the class (or type) of <tt>x</tt>, and that <tt>Y</tt> is the class of <tt>y</tt>.  The way to install a method for the addition of an instance <tt>x</tt> of class <tt>X</tt> to an instance <tt>y</tt> of class <tt>Y</tt> is with a statement of the form         <pre>X + Y := (x,y) -> ( ... )</pre>
where <tt>( ... )</tt> represents the body of the function, consisting of suitable code for the operation at hand.        <p/>
The method installed by the code above is automatically inherited by subclasses of <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>.  Here is a brief description of the way this works.  Suppose <tt>X</tt> is the <a title="parent type of an object" href="_parent.html">parent</a> of <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> is the parent of <tt>X</tt>.  When a sum <tt>p+q</tt> is evaluated where the class of <tt>p</tt> is <tt>P</tt> and the class of <tt>q</tt> is <tt>Q</tt>, then the binary method for <tt>P+Q</tt> is applied, unless there isn't one, in which case the binary method for <tt>P+Y</tt> is applied, unless there isn't one, in which case the binary method for <tt>X+Q</tt> is applied, unless there isn't one, in which case the binary method for <tt>P+Q</tt> is applied.  In general this search for a binary method continues all the way up the chain of parents to the topmost ancestor of everything, which is called <a title="the class of all things" href="___Thing.html">Thing</a>.  (See also <a title="look up methods" href="_lookup.html">lookup</a>.)        <p/>
As an extreme example of inheritance, the code         <pre>Thing + Thing := (x,y) -> ( ... )</pre>
will install a binary method for adding any two things, which will take effect as a last resort whenever more a specifically defined method isn't found.        <p/>
The <a title="new objects and new types" href="_new.html">new</a> function also uses a ternary lookup table to find the initialization function for the new thing, and should be thought of as a ternary operator.  The initialization function for a new expression created by        <pre>new Z of x from y</pre>
is obtained as        <pre>lookup(NewMethod,Z,X,Y)</pre>
Here <tt>X</tt> is <tt>class x</tt>, and <tt>Y</tt> is <tt>class y</tt>.  The initialization function can be installed with        <pre>new Z of X from Y := (z,y) -> ...</pre>
where <tt>z</tt> denotes the new hash table of class <tt>Z</tt> and parent <tt>x</tt> provided to the routine by the system.      </div>
