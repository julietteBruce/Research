    <div>
      <h1>changes, 1.17</h1>
      <div>

              <li>
The function <a title="recover the methods used to make a module" href="_formation.html">formation</a> has been added, for retrieving the way a module was formed, whether as a direct sum, tensor product, or Hom-module.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The function <a title="evaluate Macaulay2 code and capture the output" href="_capture.html">capture</a> is now used for generating most examples and tests.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage</a> accepts two new argument: <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage(...,MakeHTML=>...)</a> and <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage(...,MakePDF=>...)</a>.

              <li>
The functions <a title="add a hook function to an object for later processing" href="_add__Hook.html">addHook</a> and <a title="run the hook functions stored in an object" href="_run__Hooks.html">runHooks</a> have been modified to accept a new syntax, allow giving names to hooks, and run specific hooks using the option <tt>Strategy</tt>. The symbol <a title="value of an optional argument" href="___Default.html">Default</a> has been added for use as the name of hooks. The mutable hash table <a title="add a hook function to an object for later processing" href="_add__Hook.html">GlobalHookStore</a> has been added as a storage location for some hooks. For more information on <a href="_using_sphooks.html">using hooks</a>, see that documentation node.              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
$\LaTeX$ typesetting for the web documentation is now rendered using <a href="https://katex.org/">$\KaTeX$</a>, a JavaScript math typesetting library for browsers. As a result, $\LaTeX$ equations and matrices are rendered correctly. One notable change is that mathematical characters and equations now must be enclosed in <tt>\(...\)</tt>, <tt>\[...\]</tt>, <tt>$...$</tt>, or <tt>$$...$$</tt> in order to be rendered. See <a title="conversion of $\\TeX$ to html" href="../../Text/html/_html_lp__T__E__X_rp.html">html(TEX)</a> for more details and examples              </li>

The option <a title="an optional argument" href="___Boxes.html">Boxes</a> of <a title="a table of boxes" href="_net__List_lp__Visible__List_rp.html">netList</a> has been made more flexible to allow customization of the box; it now accepts as input a pair of lists of rows and columns.              </li>
              <li>
A brief documentation of various types of objects can be viewed using <a title="view brief documentation of a symbol" href="__qu_sp__Symbol.html">? Symbol</a>.              </li>
              <li>
The <a title="create a documentation node" href="_document.html">document</a> function now accepts three new options: <a title="acknowledgements listed in a documentation node" href="___Acknowledgement.html">Acknowledgement</a>, <a title="non-author contributors listed in a documentation node" href="___Contributors.html">Contributors</a>, and <a title="references listed in a documentation node" href="___References.html">References</a>. The content of each will appear under a subsection of the same name in the documentation. Moreover, <a title="a simple documentation function" href="../../SimpleDoc/html/_doc.html">document(String)</a> is now a synonym for <a title="a simple documentation function" href="../../SimpleDoc/html/_doc.html">doc(String)</a>.              </li>
              <li>
The <a title="evaluate a regular expression search" href="_regex.html">regex</a> function, as well as other functions that accept <a title="syntax for regular expressions" href="_regular_spexpressions.html">regular expressions</a>, have been rewritten to use the Perl regular expression syntax by default, which allows more fine-grained control of the matches. The <a title="evaluate a regular expression search" href="_regex.html">POSIX</a> extended flavor is still available as an option. The functionality is unchanged in almost all cases, except for regular expressions containing escaped special characters, where another backslash may be needed, and, in rare cases, where there are multiple options to match the regular expression. Internally, the new implementation incorporates the <a title="a collection of C++ source libraries" href="___Boost.html">Boost.Regex</a> library.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

The destinations of the links at the tops of the web pages portraying documentation nodes in a package have been altered.  The links labeled <tt>next</tt> and <tt>previous</tt> have been interchanged with the links labelled <tt>forward</tt> and <tt>backward</tt>.  This was done to bring the terminology into agreement with that used in the info nodes portraying documentation nodes.  The result can be described as follows.  By virtue of the <a title="a menu of documentation nodes" href="___Subnodes.html">Subnodes</a> option, each node is provided with a certain number of subnodes, so the documentation as a whole may be regarded as an ordered union of rooted trees, with the top node of the package serving as the root of the first one. (Ideally it would be the only one.)  The <tt>next</tt> and <tt>previous</tt> links can be used to traverse the (sibling) subnodes of a given node, in sequence.  (The various roots are also regarded as siblings.)  The <tt>forward</tt> and <tt>backward</tt> links can be used to traverse all the nodes, in depth-first sequence.  Ideally, the documentation would be structured so such a traversal results in a readable document with topics presented in a logical sequence.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality changed in a way that could break code:            <ul>
              <li>
The variable <tt>backupFileRegexp</tt> has been replaced by the <a title="an optional argument" href="___Exclude.html">Exclude</a> option to <a href="_copy__Directory_lp__String_cm__String_rp.html">copyDirectory</a>.              </li>
              <li>
The option <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage(...,InstallPrefix=>...)</a> no longer accepts a function as input. only strings containing a path to the installation prefix are accepted.              </li>
              <li>
The function <tt>localRing</tt> has been moved to the package <a title="Localizations of polynomial rings at prime ideals" href="../../LocalRings/html/index.html">LocalRings</a>.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality removed            <ul>
              <li>
The function <tt>removeHook</tt> has been removed.              </li>
              <li>
The <tt>ForestNode</tt> and <tt>TreeNode</tt> types have been made internal.              </li>
            </ul>
