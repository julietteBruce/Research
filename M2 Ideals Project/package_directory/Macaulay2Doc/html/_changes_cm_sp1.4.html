      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
major improvements and additions:            <ul>
              <li>
In preparation for running Macaulay2 in parallel using threads, the Safe C language, in which the interpreter is written, has been reworked.  The chief advantage is that now, references to top level objects now consist of a single address pointer, and thus assignment can happen atomically.  Formerly, a small integer (for identifying the type of object pointed to) accompanied the pointer, but now it is stored with the rest of the object.  Also, new keywords have been added to allow the definition of new types, support has been added for translation to C++, and support for atomic operations and thread local variables has been added.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

The <a title="simpler documentation for functions and methods" href="../../SimpleDoc/html/index.html">SimpleDoc</a> package, used for documentation in Macaulay2, has a new function, <a title="a simple documentation function" href="../../SimpleDoc/html/_doc.html">multidoc</a>, that allows multiple documentation nodes per string.  The format of the <b>Consequences</b> section has changed.  There is a new keyword, <b>Pre</b>, that allows preformatted text to be easily inserted.                </li>
              <li>

          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The debugging function <a title="trace a function each time it's run" href="_on.html">on</a> has been improved.              </li>
              <li>
Gr√∂bner bases over fields are now autoreduced, so the answer is mathematically well-defined.  Resulting changes in coefficients of polynomials in matrices returned by such functions as <a title="the syzygy matrix" href="_syz.html">syz</a> and <a title="find the minimal generators for cokernel of a matrix (low level form)" href="_complement_lp__Matrix_rp.html">complement</a> may be observed.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="basis or generating set of all or part of a ring, ideal or module" href="_basis.html">basis</a>, now is functorial: if given a matrix, it returns the matrix between the images of the bases of the source and target.              </li>
              <li>
The functions <a title="basis or generating set of all or part of a ring, ideal or module" href="_basis.html">basis</a>, and <a title="truncation of the graded ring, ideal or module at a specified degree or set of degrees" href="../../Truncations/html/_truncate_lp__List_cm__Module_rp.html">truncate(List,Module)</a> now allow partial multidegrees to be given. The result is a basis or generating set over the subring generated by variables whose initial degrees are zero.              </li>
              <li>
Various bug fixes, including several memory leaks, and an efficiency related bug where e.g. <tt>generators gb I</tt>, of an ideal over the rationals, would take a long time to compute              </li>
              <li>
<tt>TEX</tt> mode can now handle <tt>$\mapsto$</tt>.              </li>
              <li>
Addition of ideals with an expression such as <tt>I+J</tt> has been extended to work in the case where <tt>I</tt> and <tt>J</tt> are ideals in different, but compatible, rings. Here compatibility means the one is an predecessor of the other, as would be the coefficient ring of a polynomial ring or the ambient ring of a quotient ring.              </li>
              <li>
Added a new method, <a title="make a matrix from a ring element" href="_matrix_lp__Ring__Element_rp.html">matrix(RingElement)</a>, that makes a one by one matrix from a ring element.              </li>
              <li>
Added a new method <a href="_exp_lp__Ring__Element_rp.html">exp(RingElement)</a> for the exponential function applied to a nilpotent ring element.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality changed:            <ul>
              <li>
Elements of sets are now sorted before printing.              </li>
              <li>
Loading a package twice now gives an error unless you use the <a title="load a package" href="_load__Package.html">loadPackage(...,Reload=>...)</a> option. Reloading a package can lead to subtle errors.  For example, if the package creates a new type, then it will do that each time the package is loaded, and objects of that type that were created before reloading will not work after reloading.  Also, reloading a package may cause a memory leak.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="make a global user symbol from a string" href="_get__Symbol.html">getSymbol</a> now always creates a symbol in the user dictionary, whereas formerly, it provided an existing symbol, or created one in the first mutable dictionary listed by <a href="_dictionary__Path.html">dictionaryPath</a>. The reason is that the main application in a package is to create symbols to server as variables in polynomial rings to be handed to the user, and the user will need those symbols to be visible.              </li>
              <li>
The one-letter symbols, which are treated specially by <a title="variables" href="_vars.html">vars</a>, are now no longer pre-defined.  Now they are created when needed.  Packages can create them with <a title="make a global user symbol from a string" href="_get__Symbol.html">getSymbol</a>. This change is intended to prevent the kind of bug where a package unintentionally refers to or modifies a one-letter global variable.              </li>
              <li>
Packages containing unset mutable private global symbols will now be flagged with an error message, and the locations of the offending symbols will be given.  This is intended to be an aid in detecting bugs, because one common way for such symbols to arise is by misspelling the name of a function parameter or the name of a local variable.  Another way they arise is by forgetting to declare that a variable used just inside the body of a function is a local variable.              </li>
              <li>
A new way to create a polynomial ring in a package whose variables are based on symbols in the user dictionary is to put the names in quotation marks, like this: <tt>QQ[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]</tt>.  Now that the one-letter symbols are no longer predefined in the Core dictionary, something like this will be necessary, as <tt>QQ[x,y]</tt> will not work, because <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> will refer to private global symbols of the package, and will most likely now get flagged as errors.              </li>
