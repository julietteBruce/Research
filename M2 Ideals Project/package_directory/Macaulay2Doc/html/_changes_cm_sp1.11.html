              <li>
The package <a title="&quot;Resolution over a Complete Intersection&quot;" href="../../CompleteIntersectionResolutions/html/index.html">CompleteIntersectionResolutions</a> includes now the analysis of resolutions over complete intersections, and computations of the special resolutions of modules over complete intersections that were described by Eisenbud and Peeva in various papers.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="Compute Rees algebras and their invariants" href="../../ReesAlgebra/html/index.html">ReesAlgebra</a> has been improved: Corrected and completed the documentation and cleaned up code; added functionality having to do with options for computing saturation (used in the basic routines); added functionality of the 'Jacobian dual' method. Submitted JSAG article explaining the package.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="The unique Gorenstein double structure on a surface scroll" href="../../K3Carpets/html/index.html">K3Carpets</a> includes now facilities for computing with K3carpets and their generalization, the correspondence scrolls, and using the Schreyer resolution and Schreyer naming of syzygies to determine in which characteristics they have behavior other than that corresponding to Green's conjecture. The computations are used in a forthcoming preprint by Eisenbud and Schreyer.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="Localizations of polynomial rings at prime ideals" href="../../LocalRings/html/index.html">LocalRings</a> has been rewritten by Mahrud Sayrafi and Mike Stillman. Functions from the old version are still available. The new package extends various primary functions to work over local rings with respect to prime ideals. These functions include syz, res, trim, mingens, minimalPresentation, symbol //, inducedMap, symbol :, saturate, annihilate. The function hilbertSamuelFunction for modules over local rings, optionally given a parameter ideal, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
<a title="package for some computations on rational maps between projective varieties" href="../../Cremona/html/index.html">Cremona</a> has been updated from version 3.9.1 to version 4.2. The class 'RationalMap' has been improved; in particular, this affects the way how the objects of the class are displayed. Support has been added for rational maps whose source is a subvariety of a product of projective spaces. For instance 'graph(RationalMap)' returns a pair of such maps. 'composeRationalMap(rationalMap,RationalMap)' has been replaced by 'rationalMap * RationalMap' 'invertBirMap' has been replaced by 'inverseMap' 'kernelComponent(RingMap,ZZ)' has been replaced by 'kernel(RingMap,ZZ)'              </li>
              <li>
<a title="resultants, discriminants, and Chow forms" href="../../Resultants/html/index.html">Resultants</a> has been updated from version 1.0 to 1.2. 'CayleyTrick' has been changed and replaced by 'cayleyTrick' 'ChowEquations' has been replaced by 'chowEquations' 'ChowForm' has been replaced by 'chowForm' 'Discriminant' has been replaced by 'discriminant' 'Dual' has been replaced by 'dualVariety' 'Resultant' has been replaced by 'resultant' 'Xresultant(Ideal)' has been removed: use 'fromPluckerToStiefel dualize ChowForm I' instead The methods 'affineDiscriminant', 'affineResultant', 'hurwitzForm', 'macaulayFormula' has bees added.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="Classification of local rings based on multiplication in homology" href="../../TorAlgebra/html/index.html">TorAlgebra</a> replaces the package <tt>CodepthThree</tt>. In addition to the functionality of CodepthThree, the new package now also implements the classification scheme (due to Kustin and Miller) for Gorenstein rings of codepth 4. Moreover, the package recognizes complete intersection, Gorenstein, and Golod rings of any codepth via the functions isCI, isGorenstein, and isGolod.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="divisors" href="../../Divisor/html/index.html">Divisor</a> has numerous changes to core methods to make them compatible with Macaulay2 standards and conventions (including renaming many methods). Documentation is also improved throughout.  Additional functionality has also been added (for example, checking if a divisor is very ample).              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The function <a title="Constructor for local rings" href="../../LocalRings/html/_local__Ring.html">localRing</a>, for localizing a polynomial ring at a prime ideal, has been added.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="Computes the length of a module" href="_length_lp__Module_rp.html">length(Module)</a> now can compute length of Artinian modules over local rings.              </li>
              <li>
The function <a title="the preamble of a package" href="_new__Package.html">newPackage</a> now takes two new options: <tt>OptionalComponentsPresent</tt> tells whether all optional external components of the package are present on the system, and <tt>UseCachedExampleOutput</tt> tells whether to use the cached example output files.  This will be useful for packages that use external programs that are not always present, so they can seize the opportunity to rerun examples when the external programs are present and give no error when the external programs are absent.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality changed:            <ul>
              <li>
The format for multi-line (un-nested) block comments has been changed from <tt>{* ... *}</tt> to <tt>-* ... *-</tt> so emacs can colorize the comments correctly.  The (deprecated) old style will be recognized by M2 for a while.              </li>
            </ul>
