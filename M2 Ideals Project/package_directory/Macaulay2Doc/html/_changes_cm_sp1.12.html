              <li>
<img src="../../../../Macaulay2/Style/GoldStar.png" alt="a gold star"/> <a title="package for some computations on rational maps between projective varieties" href="../../Cremona/html/index.html">Cremona</a>, a package by Giovanni Staglianò for computations for rational maps between projective varieties, has been published.              </li>
              <li>
<img src="../../../../Macaulay2/Style/GoldStar.png" alt="a gold star"/> <a title="a package for working with ideals over exterior algebra" href="../../ExteriorIdeals/html/index.html">ExteriorIdeals</a>, a package by Marilena Crupi and Luca Amata for manipulating monomial ideals over exterior algebras, has been published.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
improved packages:            <ul>
              <li>
The package <a title="calculating versal deformations and local Hilbert schemes" href="../../VersalDeformations/html/index.html">VersalDeformations</a> has had a bug fixed.  The lifting algorithm would give an error or incorrect output if the tangent cone for the obstruction equations wasn't generated by the lowest order terms of the obstruction equations. This has been remedied by actually calculating the tangent cone, and making appropriate adjustments to the algorithm.              </li>
              <li>
The package <a title="Computation of parts of the Tate resolution on products" href="../../TateOnProducts/html/index.html">TateOnProducts</a> has been improved.  The package implements the method of Tate resolutions, for computing cohomology of sheaves on products of projective spaces, and also the pushforward complex of a sheaf under a map from a variety to a projective space. Tate resolutions on single projective spaces were treated in the package <a title="Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence" href="../../BGG/html/index.html">BGG</a>, but the case of a product of projective spaces is much more subtle, since no term of the full Tate resolution is finitely generated.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The function <a title="search the documentation" href="_about.html">about</a> has been added.  It allows one to search the documentation of all the packages that have been installed, optionally searching the contents, in addition to the keys. For example, the command <tt>help about X</tt> will display all the documentation about <tt>X</tt>.              </li>
              <li>
The class <a title="a type of visible self-initializing list that prints vertically" href="___Numbered__Vertical__List.html">NumberedVerticalList</a> has been added.  It's a new type of vertical list (see <a title="a type of visible self-initializing list that prints vertically" href="___Vertical__List.html">VerticalList</a>) that is also printed vertically, but with numbered entries, for ease of referring to them.              </li>
              <li>
The option <tt>AbsoluteLinks</tt> to <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage</a> has been removed.  Better logic is now used internally, producing relative links only between files installed under the same prefix.              </li>
              <li>
The layout of files into directories used by <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage</a> has been simplified, so it may be a good idea to reinstall any packages you have installed.  See <a title="relative locations of Macaulay2 files" href="_current__Layout.html">Layout</a>.              </li>
              <li>
Each directory listed in <a title="absolute locations of Macaulay2 files" href="_prefix__Path.html">prefixPath</a> now has its own layout, which is detected at runtime. See <a title="relative locations of Macaulay2 files" href="_current__Layout.html">Layout</a>.              </li>
              <li>
Functionality for fast nonminimal free resolutions, <a title="compute a non-minimal graded free resolution" href="___Fast__Nonminimal.html">FastNonminimal</a> has a number of bug fixes and improvements: (1) it now works for input modules, not just ideals (there was a monomial order mismatch which would often cause it to fail), (2) multigraded and inhomogeneous ideals/modules are allowed, (3) this function works over the exterior algebra as well (it has always done so, but that was not always realized), (4) it is possible to have M2 use an already created Groebner basis, instead of recomputing one.  Use Strategy=>5 in the <a title="projective resolution" href="_resolution.html">resolution</a> command, to tell the command that the provided ideal has generators which already form a Groebner basis, not necessarily a reduced Groebner basis, or a quotient module, whose presentation matrix forms a Groebner basis. If the input is not, then this function can give incorrect answers or fail.  See <a title="compute a non-minimal graded free resolution" href="___Fast__Nonminimal.html">FastNonminimal</a> for details and examples.              </li>
              <li>
New types <a title="a type of method function" href="___Method__Function__Single.html">MethodFunctionSingle</a> and <a title="a type of method function" href="___Method__Function__Binary.html">MethodFunctionBinary</a> were introduced to serve as classes of method functions with a single argument, such as <a title="display source code" href="_code.html">code</a>, and of associative method functions based on methods with two arguments, such as <a title="greatest common divisor" href="_gcd.html">gcd</a>, from other compiled functions.              </li>
              <li>
We have removed the feature where typing an extra empty line ends multiline input in a terminal window or emacs buffer. This will make it easier to feed input from a file into the interpreter with F-11 and encounter the same behavior, since in files we have permit empty lines. This change was requested at our Leipzig workshop, with Q2 at <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2018-Leipzig/wiki/Q&amp;amp;A-Thursday">https://github.com/Macaulay2/Workshop-2018-Leipzig/wiki/Q&amp;A-Thursday</a> being the question that prompted the discussion.              </li>
