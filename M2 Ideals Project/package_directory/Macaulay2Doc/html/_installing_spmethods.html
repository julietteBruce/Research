      <h1>installing methods</h1>
      <div>
The method to be used for computing an expression such as <tt>-x</tt> depends on the type of <tt>x</tt>.  For example, the method for negating a polynomial differs from the method for negating an integer modulo 111.  Each method is a function of one variable, and is stored in the class of <tt>x</tt> under a key that is referred to as the name of the method. For some built-in methods the method name is a symbol, but for methods created with <a title="make a new method function" href="_method.html">method</a>, the method name is the same as the function used for calling it up.        <p/>
Let's assume that <tt>X</tt> is the class of <tt>x</tt>.  The way to install a method for the negation of an instance <tt>x</tt> of <tt>X</tt> is with a statement of the following form.        <pre>- X := x ->( ... )</pre>
Here <tt>( ... )</tt> represents the body of the function, consisting of suitable code for the operation at hand.        <p/>
The method installed by the code above is automatically inherited by subclasses of X.  Here is a brief description of the way this works.  Suppose <tt>X</tt> is the <a title="parent type of an object" href="_parent.html">parent</a> of <tt>P</tt>.  When an expression <tt>-p</tt> is to be evaluated, where the class of <tt>p</tt> is <tt>P</tt>, then the method for <tt>-P</tt> is applied, unless there isn't one, in which case the method for <tt>-X</tt> is applied, and so on, all the way up the chain of parents to the topmost ancestor of everything, which is called <a title="the class of all things" href="___Thing.html">Thing</a>.        <p/>
As an extreme example of inheritance, code like        <pre>- Thing := x -> ...</pre>
will install a method for negating anything, which will take effect as a last resort whenever a more specifically defined method isn't found.  It probably isn't a good idea to install such a method, for usually all it can do is to print an error message.        <p/>
The user may introduce new methods as well as new method names.  So it is important to understand how methods are installed and consulted.        <p/>
Applying a method named <tt>C</tt> to a thing <tt>x</tt> whose class is <tt>X</tt> means that        <pre>(lookup(C,X)) x</pre>
is evaluated.  In other words, <tt>C</tt> is used as a key to obtain a function from <tt>X</tt> (or its parent, grandparent, and so on), and the function is applied to <tt>x</tt>.  See <a title="look up methods" href="_lookup.html">lookup</a>.        <p/>
Installing a method named <tt>C</tt> for the class <tt>X</tt> is done with code such as         <pre>C X := (x) -> ( ... )</pre>
where <tt>( ... )</tt> represents suitable code for the operation at hand.        <p/>
The routine for making new methods is <a title="make a new method function" href="_method.html">method</a>.      </div>
