            </ul>

          <li>
improved packages:            <ul>
              <li>
<a title="Rings representing irreducible representations of general linear or symmetric groups" href="../../SchurRings/html/index.html">SchurRings</a>, has been updated, with support for several groups of variables,  documentation, working plethysm, and more. The old version is being kept as <tt>SchurRingsOld</tt> as there are incompatible changes.  Specifically, symmRing is now called symmetricRing, and has more variables (three sets, h, e, p) than the old version.  Please use the new version, and if there is a problem that requires you to use the old version, please email Mike Stillman.              </li>
              <li>
The packages <a title="for computations with convex polyhedra, cones, and fans" href="../../Polyhedra/html/index.html">Polyhedra</a> and <a title="cohomology computations of equivariant vector bundles on toric varieties" href="../../ToricVectorBundles/html/index.html">ToricVectorBundles</a> now implement a canonical ordering for the rays in a fan.  Formerly the rays came out in an unpredictable (but deterministic) order.  Various tests in the latter package have been updated to take into account the new ordering.  Users may find that their code will have to be modified slightly, by permuting lists of parameters (such as weights) corresponding to the rays.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
A new option,  <a title="data files corresponding to a documentation node" href="___Example__Files.html">ExampleFiles</a>, has been added to the documentation function <a title="create a documentation node" href="_document.html">document</a>, which allows the package developer to specify that copies of certain auxiliary files should be visible in the current directory while example code is running.              </li>
              <li>
It is now possible to reduce each entry of a matrix <tt>f</tt> modulo an ideal <tt>I</tt> by writing <tt>f % I</tt>.  See <a title="normal form of ring elements and matrices" href="_methods_spfor_spnormal_spforms_spand_spremainder.html">Matrix % Ideal</a>.              </li>
              <li>
A task now has a serial number, see <a title="serial number of a dictionary, task, symbol, mutable hash table, or mutable list, " href="_serial__Number.html">serialNumber</a>.              </li>
              <li>
A new command line option, <tt>--no-randomize</tt>, prevents the random number seed from being set to a value that depends on the time of day and process ID.              </li>
              <li>
A new command line option, <tt>--no-time</tt>, arranges for the function <a title="get the current time" href="_current__Time.html">currentTime</a> to return 0 always, for reproducility of results, as an aid in debugging.              </li>
              <li>
A new function, <a title="submatrix consisting of rows and columns in an interval or box of degrees" href="_submatrix__By__Degrees.html">submatrixByDegrees</a>, allows the user to select a submatrix of a matrix by specifying intervals of acceptable column degrees or row degrees.              </li>
              <li>
New functions <a title="time a computation using time elapsed" href="_elapsed__Time.html">elapsedTime</a> and <a title="time a computation using time elapsed" href="_elapsed__Timing.html">elapsedTiming</a>, analogous to <a title="time a computation" href="_time.html">time</a> and <a title="time a computation" href="_timing.html">timing</a>, measure elapsed time instead of CPU time.              </li>
              <li>
A new command <a title="antipode for skew commuting polynomial rings" href="_antipode.html">antipode</a> has been added.  This function implements the anti-isomorphism between left and right modules in skew commuting poly rings. It is used when transposing a matrix over a ring with skew commuting variables, basically, so that the transpose of a complex of matrices will still be a complex of matrices.              </li>
              <li>
Hash codes of matrices have been improved - they are now computed using the first two nonzero entries in each column, whereas before the entries were not examined, and thus they do a better job of distinguishing matrices that are different.  A side effect is that hash tables whose keys involve matrices will be stored, printed, and converted to lists in a different order, which may affect some code.              </li>
              <li>
The default arithmetic for computing in finite fields ZZ/p nows uses the FLINT library (see ...). The modulus p can now be p &lt;= 9223372036854775783, i.e. the largest prime less than 2^63. HOWEVER: factorization of polynomials over such rings can only be done for primes p &lt; 2^31. TODO: CHECK THIS VALUE              </li>
              <li>
Incorporated fast linear algebra for dense (mutable) matrices over finite prime fields, using ffpack and flint              </li>
              <li>
Linear algebra for mutable matrices over arbitrary precision RR and CC approximate fields has been included. Functions which handle extended precision include determinant, rank, inverse, LUdecomposition, and solve. Functions SVD, eigenvalues, eigenvectors have not yet been extended              </li>
              <li>
Extensive changes to numerical algebraic geometry code in the engine              </li>
              <li>
The <a title="Gröbner basis, as a matrix" href="_groebner__Basis.html">groebnerBasis</a> function includes new experimental Groebner code, which is much faster in some cases.              </li>
              <li>
The {	t Macaulay2/e} engine directory now compiles cleanly, with a few warning messages left.              </li>
              <li>
The overall structure of base rings in Macaulay2 has been revamped, to allow faster code.  The downside is that because of the high use of templates, compile times have generally increased.              </li>
              <li>
Random number generation for finite fields has changed, so programs expecting a specific set of random numbers will change.              </li>
              <li>
If <tt>kk</tt> is a finite field, e.g., <tt>ZZ/5[c]/(c^2+c+1)</tt> it was possible (and still is) to write <tt>map(ZZ[a], kk)</tt>.  It was never clear what this should return, as it is not a well-defined ring map.  However, it now has different, still undefined, behavior.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
functionality changed:            <ul>
              <li>
If <a title="whether to enter the debugger when an error occurs" href="_debugging__Mode.html">debuggingMode</a> is false when a package is loaded, it will remain false during the loading of the package, even if the <a title="an optional argument" href="___Debugging__Mode.html">DebuggingMode</a> option of <a title="load a package" href="_load__Package.html">loadPackage</a> or <a title="the preamble of a package" href="_new__Package.html">newPackage</a> is set to true.  This will help the user avoid entering the debugger while already in the debugger.              </li>
              <li>
The random number seed is now initialized to 0 with <a title="set starting point for random number generator" href="_set__Random__Seed.html">setRandomSeed</a> when running examples (with <a title="load and install a package and its documentation" href="_install__Package.html">installPackage</a>) and when running tests (with <a title="perform tests of a package" href="_check.html">check</a>), to ensure predictability and uniformity of results.              </li>
