          <li>
improved packages:            <ul>
              <li>
<a title="for computations with convex polyhedra, cones, and fans" href="../../Polyhedra/html/index.html">Polyhedra</a> has been rewritten by Lars Kastner for improved performance.  Many bugs have been fixed, and there are now a large number of tests. Some changes are not backward compatible.  Some changes include:                 <ul>
                  <li>
<a title="the class of all fans" href="../../Polyhedra/html/___Fan.html">Fan</a>, is no longer a collection of Cone objects, but contains a matrix of rays (over ZZ), and a list of lists of integer indices, indicating the maximal cones.  Well-defined-ness is no longer automatically checked.  Use <a title="Checks whether a polyhedral object is well-defined." href="../../Polyhedra/html/_is__Well__Defined_lp__Cone_rp.html">isWellDefined(Fan)</a>                  </li>
                  <li>
<a title="the class of all convex polyhedra" href="../../Polyhedra/html/___Polyhedron.html">Polyhedron</a>, is now a wrapper for the homogenized cone.                  </li>
                  <li>
<a title="the class of all polyhedral complexes" href="../../Polyhedra/html/___Polyhedral__Complex.html">PolyhedralComplex</a>, is now a wrapper for the homogenized fan.                  </li>
                  <li>
<a title="the class of all rational convex polyhedral cones" href="../../Polyhedra/html/___Cone.html">Cone</a>, has basically the same functionality, except that not everything is computed ahead of time.                  </li>
                  <li>
<a title="computes all faces of a certain codimension of a Cone or Polyhedron" href="../../Polyhedra/html/_faces.html">faces</a>, now returns a list of lists of integer indices.  There are two new functions for recovering the old behavior: <a title="Returns the faces of a cone as actual cones." href="../../Polyhedra/html/_faces__As__Cones.html">facesAsCones</a> (for fans and cones), and  <a title="Returns the faces of a polyhedron as actual polyhedra." href="../../Polyhedra/html/_faces__As__Polyhedra.html">facesAsPolyhedra</a> for polyhedra and polyhedral complexes.                  </li>
                </ul>
An important difference is that objects of these classes can no longer be used as keys into hash tables, since these objects are implemented as mutable hash tables. In particular <a title="strict equality" href="___Thing_sp_eq_eq_eq_sp__Thing.html">===</a> no longer works on cones.  Instead, use a sorted list of e.g. vertices and lineality space.                <p>If you need the old behavior, load the package <a title="for computations with convex polyhedra, cones, and fans" href="../../OldPolyhedra/html/index.html">OldPolyhedra</a>. However, if possible, change your code to run with the new package.</p>
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
functionality added or improved:            <ul>
              <li>
The functions <a title="finds the inverse system to an ideal up to a given degree" href="../../InverseSystems/html/_to__Dual.html">toDual</a> and <a title="Ideal from inverse system" href="../../InverseSystems/html/_from__Dual.html">fromDual</a> have been improved and moved to the new package <a title="Macaulay's Inverse Systems" href="../../InverseSystems/html/index.html">InverseSystems</a>: they are now compatible with linear changes of coordinates.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

              <li>

              <li>
The function <a href="___Weyl_spalgebras.html">isWeylAlgebra</a> has been added.              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
